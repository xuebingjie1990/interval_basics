# Generates a random GRanges object

# Counts overlaps between query and database
#
# This function counts the number of intervals from a 
# database set of intervals that overlap with a single
# query interval. 
#
#' @param query  
#'   Interval to check for overlaps. Should be a list 
#'   object with 'start' and 'end' values.
#' @param database
#'   A data.frame, with rows corresponding to intervals,
#'   with 'starts' and 'ends' as columns.
#' @return
#'   Number of overlaps counted (as a numeric)
#' @examples
#'   query = list(start=50, end=60)
#'   database = data.frame(starts=c(35, 45, 55), ends=c(45, 65, 85))
#'   countOverlapsSimple(query, database)  # returns 2

# Measure the Jaccard similarity between two interval sets
#
# This function calculates the Jaccard Score between two
# given interval sets, provided as GenomicRanges::GRanges 
# objects. The Jaccard score is computed as the intersection
# between the two sets divided by the union of the two sets.
# @param gr1  First GRanges object
# @param gr2  Second GRanges object
# @return The Jaccard score (as numeric)

}

# Calculate pairwise Jaccard similarity among several interval sets
#
# This function makes use of \code{calculateJaccardScore}. It simply
# loops through each pairwise comparison and calculates.
#' Round the result to 3 significant figures using \code{signif}
#' @param lst A base R list of GRanges objects to compare
#' @return
#'   A matrix of size n-by-n, where n is the number of elements in lst.
#' @examples
#' lst = replicate(10, randomGRanges())
#' pairwiseJaccard(lst)
pairwiseJaccard = function(lst) {
	# Implement this function
	# Compute the pairwise Jaccard Score and return in matrix form
	# Return only 3 significant figures
